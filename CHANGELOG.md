    - `getAccessibleSessions()` now returns both owned and shared sessions for non-SUPERADMIN users.
    - New `isSessionOwner()` helper to distinguish ownership from shared access (used for protecting management endpoints).
- **Socket.IO Debug Logging**: Added detailed `[Socket]` console logs for `message.update` emissions showing keyId, remoteJid, and fromMe for easier debugging.
- **ChatWindow**: Media send now uses the same delayed-refresh pattern as text send for consistency.

### Database
- **New Model**: `SessionAccess` — many-to-many relationship between `User` and `Session` with cascade delete and unique `[sessionId, userId]` constraint.

## [v1.5.1-beta.1] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Anti-Ban Protection (Anti-Spam Rate Limit)**:
    - Per-session message queue system to prevent WhatsApp from detecting spam and banning accounts.
    - Configurable **Messages Threshold**, **Time Window**, **Min Delay**, and **Max Delay** via Bot Settings.
    - FIFO queue ensures messages are sent in order with randomized delays between sends.
    - Applies to **all** outgoing messages universally: bot replies, auto-replies, broadcasts, scheduled messages, and API calls.
    - Detailed console logging with queue status, message types, delay info, and estimated send times:
        - `📥 QUEUED` — Message enters the queue with position number.
        - `⏳ DELAY` — Rate limit reached, showing delay duration and queue depth.
        - `✅ SENDING/INSTANT` — Message dispatched with total wait time.
    - Config cached for 10 seconds to avoid excessive database queries.
    - Uses raw SQL queries for maximum compatibility (no Prisma client regeneration required).
- **Configurable Bot Command Prefix**:
    - New setting in Bot Settings to change the bot command prefix (default `#`, max 3 characters).
    - `command-handler.ts` now reads prefix from database instead of hardcoded value.
    - Menu command dynamically displays the configured prefix.
- **Max Sticker Duration UI**:
    - Added slider control (3–30 seconds) in Bot Settings for `maxStickerDuration`.
    - Previously only configurable via database — now accessible in the dashboard.

### Changed

- **API Documentation Refactor**:
    - Standardized all response schemas in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` to reflect the new `{ status: boolean, message: string, data: object }` format instead of the legacy `{ success: boolean }`.
    - Enriched the Session GET documentation to show `botConfig`, `webhooks`, and `_count` relationships.

### Fixed
- **API Quick Reference Bug**: Fixed completely outdated REST API endpoints in the Python and Node.js examples (e.g., changing `/api/chat/send` to `/api/messages/{sessionId}/{jid}/send`).
- **JID Encoding in Docs**: Added explicit `@` symbol URL encoding (`%40s.whatsapp.net`) to code examples to prevent 404 router errors.
- **Swagger UI Warning**: Suppressed `UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps` console warning from `ModelCollapse` component in Swagger UI page.
- **Anti-Spam Reliability**: Fixed socket wrapping being lost on reconnection — now wraps `sendMessage` inline in `init()` so it persists across session reconnects.
- **Prisma Schema**: Added `prefix`, `antiSpamEnabled`, `spamLimit`, `spamInterval`, `spamDelayMin`, `spamDelayMax` fields to `BotConfig` model.

---

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Collapsible Sidebar**:
    - Desktop sidebar can now be minimized to icon-only mode (260px ↔ 72px).
    - Tooltips on each menu item when collapsed for quick identification.
    - Collapse state persisted in `localStorage` across page navigations.
    - Smooth CSS transitions on width, brand logo, and user footer.
    - New `SidebarProvider` context and `SidebarShell` client component architecture.
- **Chat UI Overhaul**:
    - **Search Bar**: Filter chats by name or phone number in real-time.
    - **WhatsApp-style List**: Borderless items with hover states, left accent on selected chat.
    - **Smart Previews**: Message preview up to 45 characters, media type icons (📎 Image, Video, etc.).
    - **Relative Time Labels**: Shows "Yesterday", "Mon", "Feb 12" instead of raw timestamps.
    - **Date Separators**: "Today", "Yesterday", or full date between message groups.
    - **Rounded Bubbles**: WhatsApp-style message bubbles with tail shape and inline timestamps.
    - **Dotted Background**: Subtle dot pattern in chat window for visual depth.
    - **Mobile Back Button**: Integrated back button in chat header for mobile navigation.
    - **Colored Attachment Menu**: Each media type has a distinct color icon.
- **Media Management Page** (`/dashboard/media`):
    - Per-user access control — users only see media from their own sessions.
    - Grouped view: files organized by **Session** → **Sender/From** (collapsible sections).
    - Sender info enriched from database (pushName, senderJid via batch keyId lookup).
    - Stats cards: total storage size, file count, images, and media breakdown.
    - Search and filter by type, filename, session, or sender name.
    - Grid view with image thumbnails and file metadata.
    - Multi-select and bulk delete with per-group "Select All".
    - Full-screen image preview modal.
    - SUPERADMIN sees all sessions' media; other users see only their own.
- **Media Security API**:
    - `GET /api/media` — List media files with sender metadata, filtered by session ownership.
    - `GET /api/media/[filename]` — Serve media with session ownership check.
    - `DELETE /api/media` — Bulk delete with per-file session ownership verification.
- **Shared JID Utilities**: New `src/lib/jid-utils.ts` module with `resolveToPhoneJid()`, `batchResolveToPhoneJid()`, and `isLidJid()` for consistent JID handling across the entire codebase.
- **Tooltip UI Component**: Added `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` dependency and `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx`.

### Security
- **Media Storage Hardened**: Moved media files from `public/media/` (publicly accessible) to `data/media/` (private, requires authentication to access via API).
- **Middleware Bypass Fixed**: Removed dangerous `pathname.startsWith("/media")` and `pathname.includes(".")` rules that allowed unauthenticated access to media files and any URL containing a dot.
- **Media API Secured**: `GET /api/media/[filename]` now requires `getAuthenticatedUser()` (session or API key). Added `path.resolve()` check to prevent directory traversal attacks.
- **Media Session Ownership**: All media endpoints enforce `canAccessSession()` — users can only view, serve, and delete media belonging to their own sessions.
- **Security Headers**: Added `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Cache-Control: private` to media responses.
- **Default Catch-All**: Middleware now requires authentication for all unmatched routes instead of passing through.

### Fixed
- **Media Sender Collision**: Fixed an issue where WhatsApp `keyId` collisions across different sessions caused media files to be grouped under the wrong sender ("Unknown"). The grouping API now requires an exact match on both `sessionId` and `keyId`.
- **Media Grouping UI**: Cleaned up the 3-level media grouping UI (User > Session > Sender) to use distinct cards with better padding and clear visual hierarchy, replacing the messy nested indents.
- **JID Consistency (Webhooks)**: Webhook payloads (`from`, `sender`, `participant`) now always use `@s.whatsapp.net` format instead of `@lid`. Uses a three-tier resolution: inline `remoteJidAlt` → DB Contact lookup → fallback.
- **JID Consistency (Web UI)**: Chat list API now batch-resolves `@lid` JIDs to phone numbers before responding, ensuring the UI always displays `@s.whatsapp.net` format.
- **JID Consistency (Message Store)**: `processAndSaveMessage` now normalizes `remoteJid` and `senderJid` before writing to the database, preventing `@lid` from being stored.
- **Chat List Overflow**: Fixed long text in chat list items expanding horizontally; now properly truncated with ellipsis.
- **Session Path Parameter**: Renamed API route folder from `sessions/[id]` to `sessions/[sessionId]` for consistency with all other endpoints. Updated all 5 route handlers and API docs page.

### Changed
- **Dashboard Layout**: Lighter ambient background gradients, tighter padding on mobile (`p-3`), cleaner overall feel.
- **Webhook Refactor**: Removed duplicated `resolveToPhoneJid` and `isLidJid` from `webhook.ts` — now imports from shared `jid-utils.ts`.
- **API Docs Page**: Session endpoints now correctly show `[sessionId]` instead of `[id]` in path and parameter descriptions.

---

## [v1.4.1] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Registration Toggle**: Super Admins can now enable or disable new user registrations directly from the dashboard settings.

- **Message Search**: `GET /api/messages/{sessionId}/search` with full-text search, JID/type/sender filters, and pagination.

### Fixed
- **WhatsApp Web Group Replies**: Fixed an issue where quoted replies in group chats were silently dropped by WhatsApp Web's UI.
    - Resolved user-facing `sessionId` directly to the db CUID to ensure robust database lookups for the original message.
    - Mapped Linked Device IDs (`@lid`) back to standard phone number JIDs (`@s.whatsapp.net`) via the `Contact` table.
    - Enforced strict WA Web quote validation by perfectly mirroring the original message's `fromMe`, `messageTimestamp`, and `pushName`.
    - Always structured text quotes as `extendedTextMessage`.
- **API Consistency**: Refactored reply endpoints (`/api/messages/[sessionId]/[jid]/[messageId]/reply` and `/api/messages/[sessionId]/[jid]/reply`) to use the same `{ message: { text: ... }, mentions: [] }` format as the `/send` endpoint.
- **Auto Reply Bug**: Fixed `matchType` default in PUT endpoint — was `"exact"` (lowercase) but handler expects `"EXACT"` (uppercase), causing updated rules to silently stop matching.
- **Contacts Block/Unblock**: Added missing `decodeURIComponent(jid)` — JIDs with `%40` encoding were not being decoded.
- **Contacts GET Auth**: Replaced `auth()` with `getAuthenticatedUser()` + `canAccessSession()` to enable API key authentication and session-level access control.
- **Infrastructure**: Fixed Prisma binary target issues for better environment compatibility.

### Changed
- **Consistency**: Standardized `403` error messages to `"Forbidden - Cannot access this session"` across 11 route files.

- **Documentation**:
    - Comprehensive audit of `src/lib/swagger.ts` with complete examples for all endpoints.
    - Updated `USER_GUIDE.md` and `README.md` with new feature instructions.

### Fixed
- **Type Safety**: Resolved Prisma type definition conflicts in Auto Reply API route.
- **Stability**: Improvements to context-based message filtering logic.

    - **Media Support**: Added automatic media downloading (Images, Video, etc.). Webhook now includes `fileUrl` pointing to the saved file in `public/media`.
    - **Enriched Participant Data**: For group messages, the `sender` and `participant` fields are now objects containing detailed info (`id`, `phoneNumber`, `admin`).
    - **Standardized Fields**: Added `from` (Chat JID), `sender` (Participant/User), `isGroup`, and `remoteJidAlt` (extracted from message key) fields.
- **API Response Enrichment**:
    - **Chat History API**: `/api/chat/[sessionId]/[jid]` now returns enriched `sender` details for group messages, matching the webhook format.

### Fixed
- **Webhook Logic**: Fixed issues where `from` and `sender` were ambiguous or incorrect. `from` now consistently refers to the Chat Room, and `sender` refers to the actual sender.
- **Async Handling**: Updated message store to safely handle asynchronous webhook operations without blocking.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed
- **Frontend Webhooks**: Fixed an issue where the webhook list was empty. The dashboard now correctly matches both the Session String ID (`mysession`) and the Internal Database ID (CUID) when filtering webhooks.
## [1.0.6] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed
- **Auto Reply**: Fixed silent failure where Auto Reply would not run for new sessions due to missing `BotConfig`. Added automatic creation of default config for both new and existing sessions.
- **API `POST /api/sessions`**: Fixed issue where custom `sessionId` provided in request body was ignored. Now accepts `sessionId` correctly.
- **API `POST /api/webhooks`**: Fixed `500 Internal Server Error` when creating webhooks. The API now correctly resolves the session string ID to the database internal ID (CUID).
- **API `POST /api/system/check-updates`**: Fixed authentication issue. Now uses `getAuthenticatedUser` to allow access via API Key (previously restricted to Session Cookie only).
- **Frontend Session Selector**: Fixed issue where only "CONNECTED" sessions were listed. Now displays all sessions (Disconnected, Scanning QR, etc.) to allow management.
- **Frontend Webhooks Page**: Fixed page to respect the currently selected session in the navbar. Webhook list is now filtered by session, and creating a webhook attaches it to the active session.

### Added
- **Auto Update Check**: Implemented automatic update checking when entering the dashboard. A specific notification is created only if a new version is available.
- **Logging Configuration**: Added `BAILEYS_LOG_LEVEL` support in `.env` to configure WhatsApp Baileys logger verbosity (default: `error`).
- **Scripts**: Added `scripts/test_endpoints.sh` for verifying API endpoints via curl.

### Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Completely overwrote `docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` with comprehensive details for all endpoints (Chat, Groups, Broadcast, Spam, Sticker, Status, Scheduler, System). 
- **Environment**: Updated `.env.example` to include new logging configuration.
